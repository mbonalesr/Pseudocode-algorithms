This folder contains pseudocode exercises focused on repetitive logic, where instructions are executed multiple times using loops such as For, While, or Repeat-Until.
These programs practice concepts such as:
- Iterative calculations (factorials, powers, averages, savings)
- Conditional loops and counters
- Interval validation and accumulation of values
- Simulation of real scenarios (multiplication tables, payrolls, payments over time)
- Interactive programs with user-controlled repetition (menus, timers, number guessing)

They help learners strengthen their understanding of iterative structures and repetition control in algorithmic logic and structured programming.
