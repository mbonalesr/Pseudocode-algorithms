This folder contains pseudocode exercises focused on modular programming with functions, where tasks are
divided into reusable blocks that can be called independently.

These programs practice concepts such as:
- Defining and invoking user-created functions
- Passing parameters by value and by reference
- Returning results to the main algorithm
- Organizing logic into smaller, reusable modules
- Building interactive routines that combine multiple functions for complex tasks

They are designed for learners to strengthen their understanding of modularity, abstraction, and
structured problem-solving in algorithmic thinking and programming.
