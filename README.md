Basic pseudocode exercises solved using PSeInt. Based on the PLEDIN pseudocode course by José Domingo Muñoz.
# Pseudocode Exercises with PSeInt

This repository contains solutions to basic pseudocode exercises written using the [PSeInt](http://pseint.sourceforge.net/) environment.  
The exercises are based on the **Pseudocode Course** by **José Domingo Muñoz** from [PLEDIN]([https://www.josedomingo.org/pledin/](https://plataforma.josedomingo.org/pledin/cursos/programacion/curso/u16/index.html)), a well-known educational platform for learning programming fundamentals in Spanish.

## 📚 What you'll find here

Each `.psc` file corresponds to a small standalone algorithm designed to practice logic, structure, and basic operations using pseudocode. Topics include:

- Sequential logic
- Alternative o conditional algorithms
- Repetitive structures
- String of characters
- Arrays
- Functions
- And more
  
These exercises are beginner-friendly and ideal for anyone starting with algorithmic thinking or preparing for formal programming courses.
NOTE: *This exercises are in Spanish only*

## 🚀 How to use

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the `.psc` files using the **PSeInt** application.
3. Run or edit the code to explore how each algorithm works.
