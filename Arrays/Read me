This folder contains pseudocode exercises focused on arrays and indexed data structures, where programs
store and process multiple values under a single variable name.

These programs practice concepts such as:
- Declaring and initializing one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays
- Iterating through arrays to read, modify, and display elements
- Searching and sorting values within arrays
- Performing aggregate operations (sums, averages, maximums, minimums)
- Managing structured data like matrices, tables, and sequences

They are designed for learners to strengthen their understanding of indexed storage, bulk data handling,
and algorithmic techniques for organizing and processing collections in structured programming.
