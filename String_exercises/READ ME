This folder contains pseudocode exercises focused on string and character manipulation, where programs
process text data through indexing, slicing, and validation techniques.

These programs practice concepts such as:
- Counting vowels, consonants, and specific characters
- Extracting substrings and analyzing text positions
- Validating and formatting user input
- Converting between uppercase, lowercase, and other text transformations
- Building interactive routines that respond to textual commands

They are designed for learners to strengthen their understanding of text-based operations in algorithmic
thinking, and to develop skills for handling data beyond numbers in structured programming.
