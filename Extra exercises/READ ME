This folder contains advanced pseudocode exercises focused on integrated application logic, where multiple programming paradigms—such as arrays, functions, and loops—converge to solve complex problems.
These programs practice concepts such as:

- Developing complete game logic (e.g., Hangman) with dynamic state management.
- Implementing complex data flow using parameters passed by reference across multiple modules.
- Enhancing User Experience (UX) through console interface control and strict input validation.
- Combining string manipulation with parallel arrays for real-time data tracking.
- Debugging and optimizing algorithmic efficiency in multi-step processes.

They are designed for learners to demonstrate mastery of algorithmic thinking by assembling individual concepts into functional, robust, and interactive software solutions.
