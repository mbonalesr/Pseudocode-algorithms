This folder contains basic pseudocode exercises focused on conditional logic, where program flow is controlled by decisions using if-else statements and similar structures.

These programs practice concepts such as:

Checking whether a number is even, odd, or prime

Determining the largest or smallest among given values

Validating ranges and classifying numbers

Calculating results based on conditions (e.g., discounts, grades, intervals)

They are designed for beginners to strengthen their understanding of decision-making structures in algorithmic thinking and structured programming.
